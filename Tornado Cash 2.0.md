When users deposit funds in Tornado Cash, they generate two random numbers - secret and nullifier. These numbers are hashed and sent along with the deposit. Then the smart contract will take this hash and add it to the merkle tree that is stored and built on-chain.

The merkle root contains the users node. The contract doesn't need to have the latest version of the tree as the user will be present as a node once inserted.



```circom=
// computes Pedersen(nullifier + secret)
template CommitmentHasher() {
    signal input nullifier;
    signal input secret;
    signal output commitment;
    signal output nullifierHash;

    component commitmentHasher = Pedersen(496);
    component nullifierHasher = Pedersen(248);
    component nullifierBits = Num2Bits(248);
    component secretBits = Num2Bits(248);
    nullifierBits.in <== nullifier;
    secretBits.in <== secret;
    for (var i = 0; i < 248; i++) {
        nullifierHasher.in[i] <== nullifierBits.out[i];
        commitmentHasher.in[i] <== nullifierBits.out[i];
        commitmentHasher.in[i + 248] <== secretBits.out[i];
    }

    commitment <== commitmentHasher.out[0];
    nullifierHash <== nullifierHasher.out[0];
}
```


In order to withdraw the user must prove authenticity. The snark prover submitted by the user contains root, a public input root and private inputs: secret, nullifier,  pathElements and pathIndices.

The Zero Knowledge proof computes two hashes. A commitment hash of the secret and the nullifier. Second a hash of just the nullifier, called nullifier hash. For an external observer, these two hashes seem uncorrelated

The contract checks that the root is one of the last 100? merkle roots and whether the nullifier hash is unique. The nullifier hash prevent double spending like a nonce used in blockchain transactions?

```circom=
// Verifies that commitment that corresponds to given secret and nullifier is included in the merkle tree of deposits
template Withdraw(levels) {
    signal input root;
    signal input nullifierHash;
    signal input recipient; // not taking part in any computations
    signal input relayer;  // not taking part in any computations
    signal input fee;      // not taking part in any computations
    signal input refund;   // not taking part in any computations
    signal private input nullifier;
    signal private input secret;
    signal private input pathElements[levels];
    signal private input pathIndices[levels];

    component hasher = CommitmentHasher();
    hasher.nullifier <== nullifier;
    hasher.secret <== secret;
    hasher.nullifierHash === nullifierHash;

    component tree = MerkleTreeChecker(levels);
    tree.leaf <== hasher.commitment;
    tree.root <== root;
    for (var i = 0; i < levels; i++) {
        tree.pathElements[i] <== pathElements[i];
        tree.pathIndices[i] <== pathIndices[i];
    }

    // Add hidden signals to make sure that tampering with recipient or fee will invalidate the snark proof
    // Most likely it is not required, but it's better to stay on the safe side and it only takes 2 constraints
    // Squares are used to prevent optimizer from removing those constraints
    signal recipientSquare;
    signal feeSquare;
    signal relayerSquare;
    signal refundSquare;
    recipientSquare <== recipient * recipient;
    feeSquare <== fee * fee;
    relayerSquare <== relayer * relayer;
    refundSquare <== refund * refund;
}
```
